Public release of [ManifoldEM Python suite](https://github.com/evanseitz/ManifoldEM_Python) (Beta version) for determination of conformational continua of biomolecules from single-particle cryo-EM data. This software was developed in the [Frank research group](https://joachimfranklab.org) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in collaboration with members from [UWM](https://uwm.edu/).

As for my contributions on this project, I conceptualized and implemented the features present in the 10,000+ line (Python 3) [graphic user interface](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pe106oizw4p7uyb/GUI_Overview_VATPase.mp4?dl=0), and made numerous modifications to the backend code necessary for that use. Additionally, I worked with other members of the ManifoldEM team to add several enhancements to the original [Matlab framework](https://github.com/GMashayekhi/ManifoldEM_Matlab). A tremendous amount of troubleshooting and testing was also performed, which included over 300 open issues solved in our main repository. I was also the lead author on a comprehensive [user manual](https://github.com/evanseitz/ManifoldEM_Python/blob/main/ManifoldEM_Manual_Beta.pdf) packaged along with the Beta release, and the lead liassion with an alpha-user testing group, comprised of scientists and engineers from various cryo-EM related fields.
