SQUID (Surrogate Quantitative Interpretability for Deepnets) is a [Python suite](https://github.com/evanseitz/squid-nn) to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models. This software was developed in the [Kinney lab](https://kinneylab.labsites.cshl.edu/) and [Koo lab](https://koolab.cshl.edu/)  at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/).

For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the SQUID website, https://squid-nn.readthedocs.io/. For an extended discussion of this approach and its applications, please refer to our [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.14.567120).
