An animated segment I created for [Jennifer Aaker](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jennifer-lynn-aaker) detailing her research in Social Psychology with colleagues at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) on persuasion and the power of story. This work was featured at the 2013 [Future of Storytelling Summit](https://futureofstorytelling.org/summit) in New York City.

FoST is a self-described "intimate, invitation-only event that gathers a stimulating mix of thinkers and practitioners from diverse fields who are shaping the art, science, and business of storytelling in the 21st century". My responsibilities included storyboarding, creation of animated assets, editing, sound design, and unification of artistic vision as it related to the use of visual elements, artistic style, and motion to provide entertaining, educational content for a diverse audience.
