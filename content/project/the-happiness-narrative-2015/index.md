An animated segment I created for Jennifer Aaker detailing her research in Social Psychology with colleagues at Stanford University on happiness and purpose. This work was featured at the 2015 [Future of Storytelling Summit](https://futureofstorytelling.org/summit) in New York City, which is a self-described "intimate, invitation-only event that gathers a stimulating mix of thinkers and practitioners from diverse fields who are shaping the art, science, and business of storytelling in the 21st century".

My responsibilities included storyboarding, creation of animated assets, editing, sound design, and unification 
of artistic vision as it related to the use of visual elements, artistic style, and motion 
to provide entertaining, educational content for a diverse audience.
