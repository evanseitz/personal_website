I'm Evan Seitz, a Computational Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Simons Center for Quantitative Biology](https://www.cshl.edu/research/quantitative-biology/) at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/). My work focuses on interpreting deep neural networks trained on genomic data, with an emphasis on uncovering the regulatory mechanisms encoded in DNA sequence. 

I'm the developer of [**SQUID**](https://github.com/evanseitz/squid-nn) and [**SEAM**](https://github.com/evanseitz/seam-nn), two explainable AI methods for understanding what deep neural networks (DNNs) are learning from functional genomics data. SQUID interprets *cis*-regulatory mechanisms using surrogate models and was published in [*Nature Machine Intelligence*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00851-5). SEAM explores how genetic variation reshapes those mechanisms. I recently presented SEAM at the [ICLR Generative and Experimental Perspectives for Biomolecular Design (GEM) Workshop](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PtjMeyHcTt) with a preprint currently in preparation for journal submission.

Previously, I completed my PhD at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) with Nobel laureate [Joachim Frank](https://joachimfranklab.org/), where I developed geometric machine learning and explainability frameworks to reveal conformational heterogeneity in cryo-EM protein structures. Across both molecular and genomic systems, a central theme in my work is using machine learning â€” and rigorous interpretation â€” to make sense of biological complexity.

Before my scientific career, I worked professionally in animation and communication, including a collaboration with [Dr. Jennifer Aaker](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/jennifer-aaker) to direct and animate a series of educational videos based on research conducted at Stanford University, which premiered at the [Future of StoryTelling Summit](https://futureofstorytelling.org/) in NYC. I continue to enjoy visual storytellingâ€”especially when designing figures and communicating results. Outside of science, I enjoy hiking, biking, tennis, and board games with friends and family.
