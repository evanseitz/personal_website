My name is Evan Seitz and I am a doctoral candidate in the [Frank Lab](https://joachimfranklab.org/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in New York City. I am interested in studying complex biophysical systems through a mathematically-rigorous and creative lens. My thesis work is based on a geometric machine-learning approach to study hundreds of thousands of unorganized, extremely noisy single-particle cryo-EM images of an ensemble of biomolecules. Specifically, I use manifold embedding to elucidate metabolic function in the form of a low-dimensional energy landscape and corresponding continuum of atomic structures.  

Almost a decade ago, previous to my scientific endeavors, I was an [artist](https://vimeo.com/eeseitz). Although my path has changed, I still love to design and find ways to incorporate those skills into my scientific work. As for me personally, I enjoy learning new things and sharing my ideas and experiences with others. In my free time, I have fun hiking, bicycling, playing sports like tennis, and team-based computer games.

This website provides an overview of my work in science and education. For more information, download my {{< staticref "uploads/resume.pdf" "newtab" >}}curriculum vitae{{< /staticref >}} {{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}}
