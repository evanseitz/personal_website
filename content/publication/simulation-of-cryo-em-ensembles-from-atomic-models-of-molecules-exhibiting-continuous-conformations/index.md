abstract: Molecular machines visit a continuum of conformational states as they
  go through work cycles required for their metabolic functions. Single-molecule
  cryo-EM of suitable in vitro systems affords the ability to collect a large
  ensemble of projections depicting the continuum of structures and assign
  occupancies, or free energies, to the observed states. Through the use of
  machine learning and dimension reduction algorithms it is possible to
  determine a low-dimensional free energy landscape from such data, allowing the
  basis for molecular function to be elucidated. In the absence of ground truth
  data, testing and validation of such methods is quite difficult, however. In
  this work, we propose a workflow for generating simulated cryo-EM data from an
  atomic model subjected to conformational changes. As an example, an ensemble
  of structures and their multiple projections was created from heat shock
  protein Hsp90 with two defined conformational degrees of freedom. All scripts
  for reproducing this workflow are available online.
