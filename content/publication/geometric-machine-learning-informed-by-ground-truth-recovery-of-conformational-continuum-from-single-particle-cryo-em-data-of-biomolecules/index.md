abstract: This work is based on the manifold-embedding approach to study
  biological molecules exhibiting continuous conformational changes. Previous
  work established a method capable of reconstructing 3D movies and accompanying
  energetics of atomic-level structures from single-particle cryo-EM images of
  macromolecules displaying multiple conformational degrees of freedom. Here, we
  introduce an unsupervised geometric machine learning approach that is informed
  by detailed heuristic analysis of manifolds formed by simulated heterogeneous
  cryo-EM datasets generated from an atomic structure. These simulated data were
  generated with increasing complexity to account for multiple conformational
  motions, state occupancies and typical microscope parameters in a wide range
  of signal-to-noise ratios. Using these datasets as ground-truth, we provide
  detailed exposition of our findings using several conformational motions while
  exploring the available parameter space. Guided by these insights, we build a
  framework to leverage the high-dimensional geometric information obtained
  towards reconstituting a quasi-continuum of conformational states in the form
  of a free-energy landscape and respective 3D density maps for all states
  therein. As shown by a direct comparison of results, this framework offers
  substantial improvements relative to the previous work.
