abstract: Free-energy landscapes are a powerful tool for analyzing dynamical
  processes - capable of providing a complete mapping of a systemâ€™s
  configurations in state space while articulating its energetics topologically
  in the form of sprawling hills and valleys. Within this mapping, the path of
  least action can be derived - representing the most probable sequence of
  transitions taken between any two states in the landscape. In this article,
  POLARIS (Path of Least Action Recursive Survey) is presented as a dynamic,
  global approach that efficiently automates the discovery of the least action
  path on previously determined 2D energy landscapes. Important built-in
  features of this program include plotting of landscape trajectories and
  transition state theory diagrams, generation of text files with least action
  coordinates and respective energies, and bifurcation analysis tools that
  provide downstream versatility for comparing most probable paths and reaction
  rates.
