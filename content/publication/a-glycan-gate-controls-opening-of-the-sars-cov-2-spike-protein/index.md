abstract: SARS-CoV-2 infection is controlled by the opening of the spike protein
  receptor binding domain (RBD), which transitions from a glycan-shielded ‘down’
  to an exposed ‘up’ state to bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
  receptor and infect cells. While snapshots of the ‘up’ and ‘down’ states have
  been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy and cryo-electron tomagraphy,
  details of the RBD-opening transition evade experimental characterization.
  Here over 130 µs of weighted ensemble simulations of the fully glycosylated
  spike ectodomain allow us to characterize more than 300 continuous,
  kinetically unbiased RBD-opening pathways. Together with ManifoldEM analysis
  of cryo-electron microscopy data and biolayer interferometry experiments, we
  reveal a gating role for the N-glycan at position N343, which facilitates RBD
  opening. Residues D405, R408 and D427 also participate. The atomic-level
  characterization of the glycosylated spike activation mechanism provided
  herein represents a landmark study for ensemble pathway simulations and offers
  a foundation for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 viral
  entry and infection.
