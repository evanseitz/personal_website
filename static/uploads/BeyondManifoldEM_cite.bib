abstract  ="ManifoldEM is an established method of geometric machine learning developed to extract information on conformational motions of molecules from their projections obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). In a previous work{,} in-depth analysis of the properties of manifolds obtained for simulated ground-truth data from molecules exhibiting domain motions has led to improvements of this method{,} as demonstrated in selected applications of single-particle cryo-EM. In the present work this analysis has been extended to investigate the properties of manifolds constructed by embedding data from synthetic models represented by atomic coordinates in motion{,} or three-dimensional density maps from biophysical experiments other than single-particle cryo-EM{,} with extensions to cryo-electron tomography and single-particle imaging with a X-ray free-electron laser. Our theoretical analysis revealed interesting relationships between all these manifolds{,} which can be exploited in future work."}
